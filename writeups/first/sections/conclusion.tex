\section{Conclusion}

This first submission has shown spectral analysis to be a promising method for
automatically discovering linear representations of decision-process value
functions, even in a board game domain less clearly amenable to spectral
analysis than the spatial domains evaluated in existing work. The features
learned in these experiments, for example, are sufficiently informative to
represent an effective policy for Tic-Tac-Toe. This submission has established
some initial techniques for representation discovery in a broad class of
game-like domains, identified relevant challenges of scale, and proposed
avenues for overcoming those obstacles. Future work will continue to explore
these paths.
